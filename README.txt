To move around in Android Enigma, used either the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys or directional keys. 
You can also use the 'Spacebar' to jump around the starting area. You can collect the starting key 
and it will produce a particle effect when the player collides with the the key. Still working on the 
other parts of the level and how they are designed.
